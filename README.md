Objective:
    1.  add args to add new task
    2. complete to set a task complete
    3. delete to remove task
    4. list to list all the tasks


Solution (algo):
    1. switch case for every function
    2. create a globalize map.
    3. add will add the args[2] in the globalized map and return all the maps which are done or not.
